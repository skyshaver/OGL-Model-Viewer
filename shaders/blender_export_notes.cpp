// Include Normals: makes sure the normal vectors are included within the wavefront file (used for lighting).
// Include UVs: makes sure the texture coordinates are included if any (UV = texture coordinate).
// Write Materials: also exports a .mtl file that contains all the textures used and/or colors of the model.
// Triangulate Faces: this option makes sure that all shapes are first transformed to triangles before exporting.
